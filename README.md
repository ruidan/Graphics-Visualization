## Visualising objects in three dimensional space using particles

![Example](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i4d947sDdL8YrpndxLwRhXr_5Dq4jwtN)

### To run the project
* Naigate to the folder and start Python's SimpleHTTPSever
```
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
* Open a web browser and navigate to the default localhost
```
	localhost:8000
```

There is a red menu button on the top left of the webpage to toggle the visibility of our presentation materials.

### Triggers for interactions
* To switch between different objects
```
	Shift+S
```
* To toggle the vibration of particles, colour transitions and sound effects
```
	Shift+V
```
* To cause the object to explode outwards then returning to normal
```
	Shift+E
```
* To subject the particles in the object to gravity then return to normal
```
	Shift+D
